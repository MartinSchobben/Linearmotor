  abstract = {Purpose Dentures are subject to fracture through flexural stresses during masticatory function. Distribution of stresses under flexural loading varies from compressive to tensile stress along the thickness of the denture cross section. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of reinforcing compressive, tensile, and no stress regions of flexurally loaded rectangular bars of heat-cured denture base acrylic resin reinforced with tough E-Glass FiBER FORCE (GFF) on their fracture resistance under flexural loading. Materials and Methods Forty rectangular specimens (65 mm long \texttimes{} 10 mm wide \texttimes{} 2.5 mm thick) were prepared and divided into four groups (n = 10). Group FN had no fiber reinforcement, group FM had fiber in the middle at the no-stress neutral axis, group FC had fiber close to the surface on the compressive stress side, and group FT had the fiber close to the surface on the tensile stress side. The effect of GFF reinforcement on flexural strength (FS), flexural toughness (TG), and flexural modulus of elasticity (MOE) was evaluated. Results The mean and (SD) of the FS, TG, and MOE varied as follows. FS (MPa): group FN: 91.49 (7.88); group FM: 102.83 (13.5); group FC: 107.68 (11.21); group FT: 141.46 (14.77). TG (mJ/mm3): group FN: 0.171 (0.026); group FM: 0.236 (0.033); group FC: 0.156 (0.032); group FT: 0.347 (0.010). MOE (MPa): group FN: 2682 (761); group FM: 2601 (417); group FC: 4188 (1012); group FT: 4215 (674). Statistical analysis showed that reinforcement on the tensile side of the neutral axis yielded improvement in all properties evaluated. Conclusions Placement of the GFF close to the tensile stress side surface of the bar increased the resistance to elastic deformation (i.e., higher MOE or stiffness) and the stress level needed for flexural fracture (i.e., higher FS). In addition, more energy was absorbed by reinforced specimens before fracture occurred (i.e., higher toughness). Localized reinforcement targeting tensile stress centers is thus a practical way to improve clinical durability of dentures against intra- and extraoral fracture.},

This novel robust feedback controller can be applied to electromagnetic force, speed and position control loops in linear motors, correct the errors created by uncertainty factors in the entire system in real time, and set the system's settling time based on the application environment of the plant. Finally, we performed simulations and experiments using a PC-based motor control system, which demonstrated that the proposed robust feedback controller can achieve good performance in the controlled system with robust anti-disturbance control.},

Other critical elements besides REEs, identified by the European Commission, are also becoming less easily available. Although there is no deficiency in the earth's crust of rare earth oxides, the economic accessibility is limited. The increased demand for REEs, the decreasing export from China, and geopolitical concerns on availability contributed to the (re)opening of mines in Australia and the USA and other mines are slow to follow. As a result, short supply of particularly terbium, dysprosium, praseodymium, and neodymium is expected to be problematic for at least the short term, also because they cannot be substituted. Recycling REEs from electronic waste would be a solution, but so far there are hardly any established REE recycling methods. Decreasing the dependency on REEs, for example, by identifying possible replacements or increasing their efficient use, represents another possibility.},

  abstract = {Needle-free jet injection allows delivery of liquid drugs through the skin in the form of a narrow fluid jet traveling at high speed, minimizing the risk of accidents. The use of a controllable actuator to drive this process has many advantages, but the voice coil actuators previously used are too large and heavy for practical use with common injection volumes (1 mL). We instead propose a compact slotless tubular linear permanent magnet synchronous motor design for jet injection. The design was determined by utilizing a semi-analytical electromagnetic modeling technique to predict the performance of any given motor design, an optimization scheme for the motor mass at a given power dissipation, and an automated routine for estimating cogging force using finite-element analysis. A prototype motor was constructed, with a nominal mass of 322 g, a stroke of 80 mm, and a target operating power of 1.2 kW; experimental data show that the motor constant is within 10\% of the target, and that the cogging force is in close agreement with the model. Test ejection of water into a force sensor verified that the motor is fit for needle-free injection. The design methodology explained here shows the benefits to integrated design optimization of both the actuator and the load, particularly in systems that drive fluid pressure loads, and also opens the door to controllable injector designs for larger volumes.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting 5.6\% of the population with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor over the age of 65. Conventionally, tremor diseases like Parkinson's are treated with medication. An alternative non-invasive symptom treatment is the mechanical suppression of the oscillation movement. The purpose of this review is to identify the weaknesses of past wearable tremor-suppression orthoses for the upper limb and identify the need for further research and developments. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted by performing a keyword combination search of the title, abstract and keyword sections in the four databases Web of Science, MedLine, Scopus, and ProQuest. Initially, the retrieved articles were selected by title and abstract using selection criteria. The same criteria were then applied to the full publication text. After the selection process, relevant information on the retrieved orthoses was isolated, sorted and analysed systematically. Results: Forty-six papers, representing 21 orthoses, were identified and analysed according to the mechanical and ergonomic properties. The identified orthoses can be divided into 5 concepts and 16 functional prototypes, then subdivided further based upon their use of passive, semi-active, or active suppression mechanisms. Most of the orthoses concentrate on the wrist and elbow flexion and extension. They mainly rely on rigid structures and actuators while having tremor-suppression efficacies for tremorous subjects from 30 to 98\% using power spectral density or other methods. Conclusion: The comparison of tremor-suppression orthoses considered and mapped their various mechanical and ergonomic properties, including the degrees of freedom, weight, suppression characteristics, and efficacies. This review shows that most of the orthoses are bulky and heavy, with a non-adapted human-machine interface which can cause rejection by the user. The main challenge of the design of an effective, minimally intrusive and portable tremor-suppressing orthosis is the integration of compact, powerful, lightweight, and non-cumbersome suppression mechanisms. None of the existing prototypes combine all the desired characteristics. Future research should focus on novel suppression orthoses and mechanisms with compact dimensions and light weight in order to be less cumbersome while giving a good tremor-suppression performance.},

  abstract = {Microsized or nanosized {$\alpha$}-alumina (Al2O3) and boron nitride (BN) were effectively treated by silanes or diisocyanate, and then filled into the epoxy to prepare thermally conductive adhesives. The effects of surface modification and particle size on the performance of thermally conductive epoxy adhesives were investigated. It was revealed that epoxy adhesives filled with nanosized particles performed higher thermal conductivity, electrical insulation, and mechanical strength than those filled with microsized ones. It was also indicated that surface modification of the particles was beneficial for improving thermal conductivity of the epoxy composites, which was due to the decrease of thermal contact resistance of the filler-matrix through the improvement of the interface between filler and matrix by surface treatment. A synergic effect was found when epoxy adhesives were filled with combination of Al2O3 nanoparticles and microsized BN platelets, that is, the thermal conductivity was higher than that of any sole particles filled epoxy composites at a constant loading content. The heat conductive mechanism was proposed that conductive networks easily formed among nano-Al2O3 particles and micro-BN platelets and the thermal resistance decreased due to the contact between the nano-Al2O3 and BN, which resulted in improving the thermal conductivity.

Two mover configurations are compared in depth; one made entirely from rare-earth materials while another consisting of a hybrid (rare-earth/ferrite) magnet layout. First, the rare-earth PMSLM is optimised and designed. Based on the same design and simulation methods, a hybrid PM materials with structure PMSLM is then proposed, optimised and designed using NdFeB at the centre pole-section and ferrite at the edges. The two configurations of the PMSLM and their relative merits/demerits are compared using the simulation results of the flux density distribution in the air gap, back electromotive force (EMF), and cogging force. The hybrid-magnet structure PMLSM has a better magnetic performance, and the force ripple is reduced by around 1\%. Furthermore, the magnet material cost of the hybrid-magnet PMLSM is reduced by nearly 25\% compared with the original PMLSM. Finally, a prototype of the rare-earth and hybrid-magnet PMSLM is manufactured and tested to validate the modelling techniques and the results.},

  abstract = {A 3PRR parallel precision positioning system, driven by three ultrasonic linear motors, was designed for use as the object stage of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To improve the tracking accuracy of the parallel platform, the positioning control algorithms for the drive joints needed to be studied. The dead-zone phenomenon caused by static friction reduces the trajectory tracking accuracy significantly. Linear control algorithms such as PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) are unable to compensate effectively for the dead-zone nonlinearity. To address this problem, two types of feedforward compensation control algorithms have been investigated. One is constant feedforward with the integral separation PID; the other is adaptive feedback and feedforward based on the model reference adaptive control (MRAC). Simulations and experiments were conducted using these two control algorithms. The results demonstrated that the constant feedforward with integral separation PID algorithm can compensate for the time-invariant system after identifying the dead-zone depth, while the adaptive feedback and feedforward algorithm is more suitable for the time-varying system. The experimental results show good agreement with the simulation results for these two control algorithms. For the dead-zone nonlinearity caused by the static friction, the adaptive feedback and feedforward algorithm can effectively improve the trajectory tracking accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Linear Transportation System (LTS) and focuses on the application of a Linear Induction Motor (LIM) as a major constituent of LTS propulsion. Due to their physical characteristics, linear induction motors introduce many physical phenomena and design constraints that do not occur in the application of the rotary motor equivalent. The efficiency of the LIM is lower than that of the equivalent rotary machine, but, when the motors are compared as integrated constituents of the broader transportation system, the rotary motor's efficiency advantage diminishes entirely. Against this background, several solutions to the problems still existing in the application of traction linear induction motors are presented based on the scientific research of the authors. Thus, solutions to the following problems are presented here: (a) development of new analytical solutions and finite element methods for LIM evaluation; (b) comparison between the analytical and numerical results, performed with commercial and self-developed software, showing an exceptionally good agreement; (c) self-developed LIM adaptive control methods; (d) LIM performance under voltage supply (non-symmetrical phase current values); (e) method for the power loss evaluation in the LIM reaction rail and the temperature rise prediction method of a traction LIM; and (f) discussion of the performance of the superconducting LIM. The addressed research topics have been chosen for their practical impact on the advancement of a LIM as the preferred urban transport propulsion motor.},

Most every-day products are made by this process. Although there were efforts made to realize micro-forming for industrial application, the technology itself was seen as being insufficiently mature. Much development work needed to be done, specifically to develop a fully-automated high-volume production micro-forming machine, which is reliable and at all times ready for operation in terms of it processes, tooling, and materialhandling to ensure the successful production of micro-products.

  abstract = {Linear motors have promising application to industrial manufacture because of their direct motion and thrust output. A permanent magnetic linear oscillating synchronous motor (PMLOSM) provides reciprocating motion which can drive a piston pump directly having advantages of high frequency, high reliability, and easy commercial manufacture. Hence, researching the tracking performance of PMLOSM is of great importance to realizing its popularization and application. Traditional PI control cannot fulfill the requirement of high tracking precision, and PMLOSM performance has high phase lag because of high control stiffness. In this paper, an advancing motivation feedforward control (AMFC), which is a combination of advancing motivation signal and PI control signal, is proposed to obtain high tracking precision of PMLOSM. The PMLOSM inserted with AMFC can provide accurate trajectory tracking at a high frequency. Compared with single PI control, AMFC can reduce the phase lag from -18 to -2.7 degrees, which shows great promotion of the tracking precision of PMLOSM. In addition, AMFC will promote the application of PMLOSM to other working conditions needing high frequency reciprocating tracking performance and give PMLOSM greater future prospects.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the semiconductor industry, electronic packaging products have become increasingly demanding for equipment performance in the industry. High-precision motion platforms are widely used in these devices, so their accuracy of motion directly affects the performance of the device, and thus affects the quality of industrial products and production efficiency. The representative linear motor directly drives the XY two-dimensional platform system, and its rapid response, accurate positioning, and high reliability are widely used in semiconductor packaging equipment and other fields [1]. The permanent magnet linear motor drive method does not require an intermediate conversion link, and can directly provide a linear motion, thereby reducing the error introduced by the drive chain, and can provide a drive force without contact, thereby obtaining a higher operating speed and a higher repetitive positioning accuracy which makes the system more stable [2]. Therefore, a permanent magnet linear motor is widely used in an XY two-dimensional platform system. However, a feedback control of a permanent magnet linear motor may cause a problem of motor response delay, which affects the tracking accuracy of the motor [3]. Adding a feedforward controller to the feedback control can effectively solve this problem and improves the motion accuracy of the XY platform [4]. This paper introduces a linear motor direct drive XY two-dimensional platform system, which is characterized in that the XY platform controller incorporates a feed forward controller based on feedback control. Then introduces the hardware system of this controller, introduces its control object, and its control system. Comparing the performance of the feedforward controller with that of the controller without adding the feedforward controller, the main difference is the static error and settling time. The experimental results of the two control modes show that the latter has better real-time and fast response, and can improve the real-time and movement accuracy of the XY platform.},

Least square optimization is carried out to identify the model, and the weakness of fast Fourier transform (FFT) in PMLMs with short translators for precise wavelength determination is discussed. The identified model is used as a directional estimator in a closed-loop controller to compensate the disturbance forces induced by the PMLM to a secondary mechanism.

  abstract = {Tremor is a progressive neurological disease involving involuntary rhythmic muscle movements and oscillations of the human body parts by alternating contractions of muscles. Tremor is a common symptom that can severely limit the independence of affected individuals and their ability to perform activities of daily living. In this paper, a permanent magnet linear motor (PMLM) and a notch filter with an adaptive frequency estimator are employed to suppress pathological tremor. The effects of undesired intrinsic forces exhibited by the use of PMLM were minimized by development and parameter identification of a dynamic force model. The experimental evaluation of a real-time adaptive tremor identification and suppression controller was performed in a human joints emulator using recorded signals from participants with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. We employed wavelet transform to analyze the tremor signals and the performance of the controller in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results showed an average tremor suppression of 30.51~dB (97.0\%) and 13.89~dB (79.8\%) in the first and second tremor frequency components, respectively. The average resistance induced by the orthotic mechanism against the voluntary motion was 0.36~N, and a 7.74~dB reduction with an active force compensator was observed. Compared to a servo-pneumatic actuator, a PMLM offers higher energy efficiency at a comparable suppression performance.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of deep learning has opened a new door to the exploration of topology optimization methods. The combination of deep learning and topology optimization has become one of the hottest research fields at the moment. Different from most existing work, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the method of directly using neural networks (NN) to carry out topology optimization. Inspired by the idea from the field of ``Inverting Representation of Image'' and ``Physics-Informed Neural Network'', a topology optimization via neural reparameterization framework (TONR) that can solve various topology optimization problems is formed. The core idea of TONR is Reparameterization, which means the update of the design variables (pseudo-density) in the conventional topology optimization method is transformed into the update of the NN's parameters. The sensitivity analysis in the conventional topology optimization method is realized by automatic differentiation technology. With the update of NN's parameters, the density field is optimized. Some strategies for dealing with design constraints, determining NN's initial parameters, and accelerating training are proposed in the paper. In addition, the solution of the multi-constrained topology optimization problem is also embedded in the TONR framework. Numerical examples show that TONR can stably obtain optimized structures for different optimization problems, including the stress-constrained problem, structural natural frequency optimization problems, compliant mechanism design problems, heat conduction system design problems, and the optimization problem of hyperelastic structures. Compared with the existing methods that combine deep learning with topology optimization, TONR does not need to construct a dataset in advance and does not suffer from structural disconnection. The structures obtained by TONR can be comparable to the conventional methods.},
